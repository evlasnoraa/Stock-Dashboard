# Stock Dashboard Web App

This is a web app that is inspired by popular stock trading apps like **Freetrade**, **Rise by Motilal Oswaal**, and of course, **Yahoo Finance**. In this app, I have created a dynamic dashboard for any company available on Yahoo Finance. The user can choose the time period over which they want to view the dashboard. 

Additionally, I have also displayed summary statistics for different time periods that capture the stock performance. Finally, I display a **30-day forecast** using the **Holt-Winters Triple Exponential Smoothing** algorithm.

The goal of this website was **NOT** to demonstrate my investment knowledge or UI/UX expertise. However, it was to demonstrate how a simple dashboard can be made quite easily within 2–3 days using tools like **Streamlit**. I also took this opportunity to practice my **commenting skills** on the `.py` file. So check it out! :)
